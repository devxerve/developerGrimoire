SELECT * FROM subject
WHERE term = 1 AND career IN('Computer Science', 'Physics')
```
```sql title="[NOT]IN" Group="IN"
SELECT * FROM subject
WHERE term = 1 AND career NOT IN('Computer Science', 'Physics')
```
## BETWEEN
Permite comprobar si el resultado de una expresión está o no incluido entre dos valores dados
Checks if the result of an expression is included between 2 values

```sql title="Between" Group="Between"
SELECT * FROM student
WHERE YEAR (birthDate) BETWEEN 1990 AND 1999;

```sql title="ALL"
SELECT * FROM subject
WHERE term = 2 AND career = 'Computer Science'
AND hours > ALL(SELECT hours FROM subject

--subjects from 2nd term with >hours than ALL of 1st term subjects--

## ANY
True if the comparison complies for at least ONE value of the [[sql - subQuerys|sub-query]] .
```sql title="ANY"

WHERE term = 2 AND career = 'Computer Science'
  AND hours > ANY (SELECT hours FROM subject
					WHERE term = 1 AND career = 'Computer Science');
--subjects from 2nd term with >hours than ONE of 1st term subjects-- 
```

## LIKE
Checks if a value matches a pattern using wildcards.

```sql title="LIKE" group="like"
-- column1 from student if name starts with 'A'
